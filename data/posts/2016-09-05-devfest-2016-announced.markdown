Hello everyone,

Have you ever been on any Devfest before? Have you ever met in one weekend hundreds of people with the same interests and passion as you have? Have you ever been in Pilsen?
No? Then it is a great pleasure for us to welcome you here on Google Devfest 2016 website.

Even though we guys from the tech world, usually work alone, in a dark room with poor light conditions untill sunrise. We sometimes just want to have fun as the others.

Yeah, you can go to a cinema or football match, but we think we have better solution for you.
This year's Devfest is simply going to be mind blowing. It is the first time we have gotten together so many great speakers under one roof for a weekend. Additionaly, we never had so many interesting attendees in one place. We never had so good warm up party.
And finaly, we never had so wide portfolio of talks.

Are you backend specialist, mobile apps developer or you are just into inovations? No problem, you will be amazed. Do you love data? Do you want to make something cool with cloud technologies?

There will be also tracks about marketing, project and product management â€¦ and maybe we will be accompanied with drons will fly around us. Therefore it would be such a shame if you would not come because we are looking forward for you!

We hope you will help us make this event epic and wish you a continous beautiful day!
